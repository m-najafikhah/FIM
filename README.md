File Integrity Monitoring

This is Basic File integrity Monitoring for a folder in any OS, But I just tested it on Windows 11.

When the script is run for the first time it can process all the files in the input list and store their current state. 
When the script is run again it is able to detect changes in the content of the files being monitored and will notify the user who is running the script.
